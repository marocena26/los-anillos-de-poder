## 🚀 Introduction

In this repository you can find the files generated in the **mid evaluation of Module 2 - JS** within **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s Web Development Bootcamp - Promo Radia**.

The main objective is to develop a **Small battle game in Spanish** set in Middle-earth "Los anillos de poder". The main **requirement** is that **JavaScript** is used for **development**.

## 📝 Requirements

With a **[Adalab](https://adalab.es/)'s design** as the starter point, the exercise consists on developing a web-site using the following **elements**:

- **JS**

The following **requirements** have to be respected:

1. When **starting the game**, a drop-down is displayed for the user to **select the member** of the army of the good she **wishes to play with**.
2. At the **start of the game** the **computer will randomly generate a member of the army of evil** from the five available.
3. When **clicking on "Battle"**, the **result** of the battle **appears on the screen** the race with the highest value wins.
4. Underneath, the **following texts appear** in the next section:
    - When the page **starts**: **The battle begins**.
    - When the **player** enters a race **higher than the random race** and clicks on Battle: **The Army of Good! Congratulations**.
    - When the **player** enters a race **smaller than the random race** and clicks on Battle: **The Army of Evil has won! Try Again**.
    - When the **player** enters a race **equal** to the random race and clicks on Battle: **Tie**.

To make the game we have to perform the following functionalities from JavaScript:
- Create a minimal layout with the select, the button and the space for the result.
- Generate five random numbers between 1 and 6 for the member of the army el mal, with the help of `Math.random` and `Math.ceil`. 
- Compare the value of the race that the player has selected with the random race and paint the corresponding corresponding result on the screen.

#### Bonus

The game also has the following **functionalities**:
- The **points** for each player should **appear at the bottom**. 
- The **game ends when it reaches 10 moves**, add the necessary code to display a Reset Game button to restart the game when this condition is met and the Play button disappears.
- When we **click on the Restart Game button**, this **button disappears**, reset all the **counters to zero** and the and the **Play button reappears**.
- When the **game ends**, it **shows who has won the game**: the computer or the user.

## 🛠️ Tools

The following tools have been used when solving the project:

- **HTML** (with partials for an easier lecture and project organization)
- **CSS Flexbox**
- **GIT version control**
- **JS**

## 💾 Steps to follow to use this project on your computer:

1. Click on the top right corner > **Fork**.
2. It will ask you to choose which GitHub user you want to fork it to. **Choose your user**.
3. **Go to github.com/your-user/name-of-project**, **clone it** and do whatever you want, you can rename the repo, change the code, redeploy it to GitHub Pages...
4. **Finally** and for everything to work properly, **you must disable GitHub Pages and re-enable** it so that GitHub generates the new URL correctly.
